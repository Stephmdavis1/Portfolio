              Authenticity is the ability to interact honestly with the world around you. It's a concept that describes the relationship between our core selves and the outside world. Authenticity can help to identify life values, practice compassion and accepting oneself... not just personally but through the work we create.

              I am energized by doing work that is
              unique and beautiful to me. I've had the realization recently that creating such amazing work stems from my perspective on life, my skills, past experiences and personal aesthetics
              allowing me to produce something that cannot be created by anyone else. When the things we create are infused with our own self expression, we come up with designs that are not only memorable but also enriching allowing it to resonate with its audience in such a beautiful and unique way.

            <p className="career_copy">
              I want to uplift and highlight amazing people and businesses using the medium of web design to tell stories in surprising, beautiful and powerful ways.

            <p className="career_copy">
              Creating work that is out of my confort zone really stretches me. It allows me to think outside of my "box" and to push past what I think is possiible and the results are amazing. When I step back and realize that the only restraints I have on my abilities are the ones I have placed on myself, I begin to see that all it takes is a little confidence and courage to shatter those self-biding thoughts and create what I never thought was possible.

            <li className="career__title">Make Web Design Fun</li>
            <p className="career_copy">
              At the end of the day, I think design can be creative, rewarding and purely fun. I want to work on more projects simply because they give me joy. I've had the opportunity to work with businesses and clients that are passionate and love what they do - that makes it so much more enjoyable when I am able to capture and display that within the designs I create.
