            <p>
              I was in the fitness industry for over 10 years. Being in the industry for so long allowed me to really find a love and passion for writing effective and challenging workout programs. I still have many individuals reaching out to ask if I could write them a plan. So I decided to build a website where I can sell all of my programs to anyone who is looking to challenge themselves and to work on becoming the best version they can be.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>I have created many websites. I've built with Vanilla Javascript, React and Nextjs however, this project stretched me to a place I never thought I would be able to go. I hit SO MANY roadblocks. I cried, I got angry, I took many small vacations from this build but in the end I was able to create a website that embodies my passions and showcases some of my best written programs.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The design I created aimed to bring a modern and sleek approach to
              compete with other big name fitness influences but there is so much of my personality sprinkled in. I am so proud of this build because of all the development and design knowledge I gained along the way. Keep scrolling down to take a peek at the most intense web dev I have had to date.

          <h5>The Cart Feature</h5>
            <p>
            Building the cart functionality was definitely the most difficult part of this e-commerce website. This was the first time I was including a back end to a web app so the amount of research I did was a lot. There were so many ways that I could have included into this build: APIs and hosting on other websites and then linking it to my domain. Although it was a challenge, the knowledge I gained from it was amazing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>This website is equipped and linked with Stripe payments which allows for product pricing to be hosted on their website. When a user finds the program they want, they can add it to the cart and pay for the program using any major credit card. I integrated Stripe by linking the Price_ID provided by Stripe with the ID of each program in my database. Using Stripe's API keys I was able to integrate their checkout page into my website for a seamless checkout experience.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Using other software like EmailJS, Stripe's receipt function and building my own server using Node I was able to build a beautiful e-commerce site that is properly functioning and created with the user in mind.

              Creating a user-centered design for Stephanie Marie Fitness was both a challenging and a rewarding experience. The final UI design was modern, vibrant, and consistent. This provided users with a seamless and enjoyable experience when purchasing from my website. I love how the
                website takes a new client through the process of finding a workout program and allowing them to purchase it without leaving the webpage. This responsive website evolved and expanded to include
                and highlight all the features of an amazing e-commerce website.
